1.0.6.9000
=====

* If there is not content type in a request response, return `NULL` instead of `""`. This allows for graceful fall-through within webdriver. (#72)


1.0.6
=====

* Better display of error messages. (#60)

* Resolved #59: `run_phantomjs()` now checks that a port is available before telling PhantomJS to start and listen on that port. It also provides more informative error messages if unable to connect. (#62)

1.0.5
=====

* Make sure stdout and stderr output is recorded.

* Try to find locally-install phantomjs first.

* `Session$new()` now checks that the phantomjs binary was built with ghostdriver support.

=====

First public release.
